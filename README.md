# 🚀 Delivering a Static Website Globally with CloudFront: AWS CDN Project

---

## Project Overview  
I built a globally accessible static website using **Amazon S3** and **AWS CloudFront** as part of the **presentation tier** in a scalable **three-tier architecture**. This project focused on enhancing performance and security through **edge delivery** and restricted origin access.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🗂 **Configured Amazon S3 Bucket**: Set up an S3 bucket to store and serve static website files.  
- 🌍 **Deployed CloudFront Distribution**: Used CloudFront to deliver content globally with low latency.  
- 🔒 **Enabled Origin Access Control (OAC)**: Secured the S3 bucket by allowing only CloudFront to access its objects.  
- ⚙️ **Optimised Delivery Settings**: Tuned caching and distribution settings to improve performance and availability.

---

### Next Phase:  
- 🛡 **Integrate AWS WAF**: Add web application firewall rules for additional threat mitigation at the edge.  
- 📈 **Monitor Usage with CloudWatch**: Track request patterns and optimise caching policies.  
- 🧩 **Expand to Full Architecture**: Continue building the logic and data tiers for a complete three-tier deployment.

## Why CloudFront & S3?  
By combining **Amazon S3** with **AWS CloudFront**, I achieved **low-latency, secure, and scalable** content delivery. Using **OAC**, I ensured that all files are served securely through CloudFront, blocking direct public access to the S3 bucket. This architecture enhances both **performance** and **security** — key requirements for modern web applications.
